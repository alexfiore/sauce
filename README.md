Provide three functions, which all take an unsorted array of boolean values. The functions sort the arrays with all the false values placed before the true values.

Ex. 

input = [true, false, true, false]

output = [false, false, true, true]

Which runs the fastest? 

Which uses the least number of arrays?

Which is the easiest to understand?
