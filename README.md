Sauce Coding Challenge
---
Provide three functions, which all take an unsorted array of boolean values. The functions sort the arrays with all the false values placed before the true values.

<b>For example:</b><br>
input = [true, false, true, false]<br>
output = [false, false, true, true]
<br><br>

Which runs the fastest? <br>
Which uses the least number of arrays?<br>
Which is the easiest to understand?
