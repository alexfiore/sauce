Sauce Coding Challenge
---
Provide three functions that all take an unsorted array of boolean values and sorts them with all the false values placed before the true values.

Ex. 

input = [true, false, true, false]
output = [false, false, true, true]

Which runs the fastest? 
Which uses the least number of arrays?
Which is the easiest to understand?
